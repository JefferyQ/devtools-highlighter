# TODO

* Display list of elements in the panel
* Allow to change highlighting color
* Better highlighter that doesn't touches elements themselves
* Allow to show guides
* Search by CSS queries too (find all elements that are absolutely positioned, or that are grid containers)
* Click to scroll into view from the list of results
* Limit to N results by default to avoid long running requests
* Click to inspect() in inspector panel
* Verify the tabId filtering thing (multiple devtools instances, multiple pages ...)
